# Planner

This code uses svg template files to generate pdf planner files.

## Template Requirements

In order to edit the template files for each day and week, the template needs to tag the elements that will be changing.

### Daily Template

- Day number
- Day name (Will be a single letter, MTWRFSO. Thursday is R to avoid conflict with Tuesday, and Sunday is O as a reference to the symbol for the sun being a circle with a dot in the middle.)
- Month (Will be spelled out in full)
- Year

### Weekly Template

- Monday Date
- Tuesday Date
- Wednesday Date
- Thursday Date
- Friday Date
- Saturday Date
- Sunday Date
- Month
- Year


## Template Dimensions

While the template files can be of any dimension you desire, the ones in this directory were created for GoodNotes on an iPad in landscape as defined in the [GoodNotes Documentation](https://support.goodnotes.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403641962383-What-are-the-page-dimensions-of-built-in-GoodNotes-templates-).
